# World_Weather_Analysis

Note ~ In this repository I have added all the challenge related folder under Module_6_challenge

Analysis 1: Weather_Database
 - For this Analysis we gathered random coordinates and using those coordinates we generated a list of cities. 
 - Then with help of API calling we gathered the city weather details and stored it in a Dataframe and then exported the information into a csv for further use 
 - The details included Max temparature, humidity, cloudiness, windspeed, description etc 

Analysis 2: Vacation_search
- Using user input on Max and Min tempareture a custom list of cities were created for potential vacation spots
- Further, based on this list nearby hotels were added
- Finally these details were stored in a dataframe and exported in csv

Analysis 3: Vacation_Itinerary
- Finally an Itinerary was created using 3 other nearby city locations and providing driving, bicycling and walking directions to those nearby spots
- Hotel details were also added for the stay
